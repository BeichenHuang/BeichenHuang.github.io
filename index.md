## About Me

Hello and welcome! I'm Beichen Huang, a first-year MSCS student at UIUC, supervised by [Prof. Minjia Zhang](https://minjiazhang.github.io/) at [SSAIL](https://supercomputing-system-ai-lab.github.io/). I am working on LLM inference, and my current research interests are:
- efficient test time scaling
- model compression and quantization

I am currently looking for an intern position for summer 2026.
