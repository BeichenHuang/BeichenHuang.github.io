## About Me

Hello and welcome! I'm Beichen Huang, a senior student at McMaster University, majoring in Mechatronics Engineering. My current research interests lie in affordable and efficient LLM, through mathematical optimization and machine learning system.

I had a wonderful research visit at [the Chinese Unviersity of Hong Kong (ShenZhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by [Prof. Kaiming Shen](https://kaimingshen.github.io/index.html), working on optimization and its application in machine learning and wireless communication. I am also fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Minjia Zhang](https://minjiazhang.github.io/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), focusing on MoE model quantization.
