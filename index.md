## About Me

Hello and welcome! I'm Beichen Huang, a senior student at McMaster University, majoring in Mechatronics Engineering. My current research interests lie in building **affordable and efficient LLM**, through **optimization** and **machine learning systems**.

I had a wonderful research visit at [the Chinese Unviersity of Hong Kong (ShenZhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) from Sept. 2023 to May 2024, advised by [Prof. Kaiming Shen](https://kaimingshen.github.io/index.html), working on optimization and its application in machine learning and wireless communication. I am also fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Minjia Zhang](https://minjiazhang.github.io/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) from March 2024, focusing on MoE model quantization, and model compression.

I am currently looking for PhD opening in Fall 2025, and summer research intern in 2025.
